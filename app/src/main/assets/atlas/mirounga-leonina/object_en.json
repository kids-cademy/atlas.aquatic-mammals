{"index":31,"rank":0,"name":"mirounga-leonina","display":"Southern elephant seal","definition":"The southern elephant seal  is one of the two species of elephant seals.","description":"<p>The southern elephant seal is the largest extant marine mammal that is not a cetacean.</p><p>It gets its name from its massive size and the large proboscis of the adult male.</p><p>The southern elephant seal is distinguished from the northern elephant seal by its greater body mass and a shorter proboscis. </p><p>This species also exhibit the greatest sexual dimorphism of any mammal in terms of mass ratio, with males typically 5 to 6 times heavier than females.</p><p>On average female southern elephant seals weigh 400 to 900 kilograms and measure 2.6 to 3 meters long.</p><p>By contrast, bulls can range from 2,200 to 4,000 kilograms and grow to 4.2 to 5.8 meters in length.</p><p>Southern elephant seals live in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters that feature brutally cold conditions but are rich in the marine foods these seals enjoy.</p><p>Southern elephant seals breed on land but spend their winters in the frigid Antarctic waters near the Antarctic pack ice.</p><p>These seals forage largely on deep-sea cephalopods and other molluscs, and various fish species, including lanternfish and nothothens.</p><p>Their diet also include krill and other crustaceans, and even algae.</p><p>Weaned pups, juveniles and even adults of up to adult male size may fall prey to killer whales.</p><p>Cases where weaned pups have been attacked and killed by leopard seals and sea lions have been recorded. </p><p>Great white sharks have hunted elephant seals near Campbell Island, while bite marks from a southern sleeper shark have been found on surviving elephant seals in the Macquarie Islands.</p><p>Elephant seals are polygynous, and the dominant male is in control of mating access to a group of females. </p><p>After a gestation period of 7 to 9 months a single pup is born. </p><p>Pups are born with fur and are completely black. </p><p>Their coats are unsuited to water, but protect infants by insulating them from the cold air.</p><p>Pups are generally weaned around age of 20 to 27 days.</p><p>Elephant seals are among the seals that can stay on land for the longest periods of time, as they can stay dry for several consecutive weeks each year. </p><p>While on water, these seals spend very little time on the surface, usually a few minutes for breathing. </p><p>They dive repeatedly, each time for more than 20 minutes, to hunt their squid and fish, at depths between 400 and 1,000 meters. </p><p>Southern elephant seals are the deepest diving air-breathing non-cetaceans and have been recorded at a maximum of 2,388 meters in depth.</p><p>After their near extinction due to aggressive hunting in the 19th century, southern seal population recovered and currently is estimated at 325,000 animals.</p><p>Most of their important breeding sites are now protected by international treaty, as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, or by national legislation.</p><p>Southern elephant seals are currently classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/mirounga-leonina/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/mirounga-leonina/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/mirounga-leonina/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/mirounga-leonina/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/mirounga-leonina/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/mirounga-leonina/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-22T08:44:07Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Mirounga"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Mirounga
