blue skin color with a white to light grey stripes, running along the spine.</p><p>The belly of the animal is lighter than sides. </p><p>This unique coloration distinguishes the animal from other dolphin species. </p><p>Anyway, the coloration of this animal may vary greatly depending on habitat and helping the dolphin easily merge with the environment. </p><p>As the dolphins age, the coloration and stripes on their body become more emphatic. </p><p>In some parts of their range, the Striped dolphins are occasionally called streakers due to their ability of moving very fast in order to avoid boats.</p><p>Striped dolphins inhabit both offshore and inshore areas, preferring warm-temperate and tropical waters. </p><p>The area of their distribution covers a huge territory, including the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and the northern Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>These dolphins are opportunistic feeders, though they are primarily piscivorous and molluscivorous. </p><p>They generally prefer fish - especially lantern fish, cephalopods and crustaceans.</p><p>Striped dolphins natural predators include some sharks like tiger, dusky and bull sharks, and killer whales. </p><p>These dolphins are also often trapped in fishing nets.</p><p>Currently, very little is known about the mating system of striped dolphins, although is believed to be polygynous. </p><p>Females usually give birth every 4 years. </p><p>Gestation period lasts for 12 to 13 months. </p><p>Females and their young are known to form mothers-and-calf schools. </p><p>Newborn calves live in these groups with their mothers for 16 months, after which they are weaned. </p><p>When it comes the age, males of this species are usually able to mate within 7 to 15 years, whereas females are ready to mate at 5 to 13 years old.</p><p>Striped dolphins are highly social animals, known to gather in large schools, consisting of more than 1000 individuals. </p><p>However, they most commonly appear in smaller groups of 100 to 500 animals. </p><p>These active and playful animals are known to perform a variety of aerial maneuvers. </p><p>They can often be observed enthusiastically swimming along a vessel and accompanying the performance with twists and jumps. </p><p>Other maneuvers they perform include chin slaps as well as breaching or jumping out of water.</p><p>According to the IUCN Red List, the worldwide population size of the striped dolphin is over 2 million individuals.</p><p>Currently, striped dolphins are classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/stenella-coeruleoalba/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/stenella-coeruleoalba/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/stenella-coeruleoalba/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/stenella-coeruleoalba/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/stenella-coeruleoalba/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/stenella-coeruleoalba/icon.jpg","caption":null},"trivia":{"path":"atlas/stenella-coeruleoalba/trivia.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/stenella-coeruleoalba/trivia.png","caption":"<p>Striped
