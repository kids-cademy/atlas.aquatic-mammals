{"index":23,"rank":0,"name":"monachus-monachus","display":"Mediterranean monk seal","definition":"The Mediterranean monk seal  is a monk seal belonging to the family Phocidae.","description":"<p>Adult Mediterranean monk seals can be any color from dark brown or black to light grey. </p><p>They are usually light gray along the belly.</p><p>Males weigh an average of 320 kilograms and females weigh 300 kilograms, with overall weight ranging from 240 to 400 kilograms.</p><p>The snout is short broad and flat, with very pronounced, long nostrils that face upward, unlike their Hawaiian relative, which tend to have more forward nostrils.</p><p>There are eight pairs of teeth in both jaws.</p><p>The flippers are relatively short, with small slender claws.</p><p>They are thought to live up to 45 years old.</p><p>The habitat of Mediterranean monk seals has changed over the years. </p><p>Until the 20th century, they had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. </p><p>In more recent times, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for these activities. </p><p>Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans.</p><p>Mediterranean monk seals are diurnal and feed on a variety of fish and mollusks, primarily octopus, squid, and eels, up to 3 kilograms per day. </p><p>They are known to forage at depths up to 250 meters, with an average depth varying between specimens.</p><p>Monk seals prefer hunting in wide-open spaces, enabling them to use their speed more effectively. </p><p>They are successful bottom-feeding hunters; some have even been observed lifting slabs of rock in search of prey.</p><p>Mediterranean monk seal generally have no known predators, although a few reports describe predation by killer whales and sharks.</p><p>Pregnant Mediterranean monk seals typically use inaccessible undersea caves while giving birth.</p><p>The monk seals' pups are about 1 meter long and weigh around 15 to 18 kilograms, their skin being covered by 1.5 centimeters long, dark brown to black hair.</p><p>On their bellies, there is a white stripe, which differs in color and shape between the two sexes.</p><p>This hair is replaced after six to eight weeks by the usual short hair adults carry.</p><p>The Mediterranean monk seal spends most of its time in a limited range; they don't migrate long distances. </p><p>There can be up to 20 individuals in a colony of Mediterranean monk seals. </p><p>On land, the seal is a solitary species.</p><p>In the water, they are very good divers and swimmers. </p><p>They swim so well that they can outmaneuver a shark.</p><p>As of 2015, it is estimated that fewer than 700 individuals survive in three or four isolated sub-populations in the Mediterranean.</p><p>It is believed to be the world's rarest pinniped species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/monachus-monachus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/monachus-monachus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/monachus-monachus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/monachus-monachus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/monachus-monachus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/monachus-monachus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-22T12:31:21Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Monachus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Monachus
