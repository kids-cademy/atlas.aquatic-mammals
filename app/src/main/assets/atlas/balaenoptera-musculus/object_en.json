Thousands of krill are left behind, and then swallowed.</p><p>The predators of the blue whale are very few. </p><p>The only animals recorded attacking a blue whale are packs of killer whales. </p><p>However, the number one predator of the blue whale is our very own, mankind!</p><p>The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, yet the breeding grounds of this elusive creature have remained a mystery.</p><p>Calves enter the world already ranking among the planet's largest creatures. </p><p>After about a year inside its mother's womb, a baby blue whale emerges weighing up to 3 tons and stretching to 7.6 meters. </p><p>It gorges on nothing but mother's milk and gains about 90 kilograms every day, for its first year.</p><p>Blue whales communicate via songs. Scientists believe that whales can hear songs even if they are 16,000 kilometers away from each other.  </p><p>Blue whales produce sounds for echo-location also: they navigate through the water by listening the sound which bounces off from the objects in front of them.</p><p>Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the beginning of the twentieth century.</p><p>For over a century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whaling, until protected by the international community in 1966.</p><p>The IUCN estimates that there are probably between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales worldwide today.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-musculus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-musculus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-musculus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-musculus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-musculus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-musculus/featured.png","caption":"<p>At up to 29.9 meters in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes, it is the largest animal known to have ever existed.</p>\n<p>Blue whales look true blue underwater, but on the surface their coloring is more a mottled blue-gray.</p>\n"},"icon":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-musculus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-musculus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-19T12:07:48Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Balaenopteridae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Balaenoptera"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Balaenoptera musculus"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"World Ocean","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":2.58,"mask":132102},"endDate":null,"conservation":"EN","sampleTitle":"Blue whale song","samplePath":"atlas/balaenoptera-musculus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/balaenoptera-musculus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-musculus/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Largest animal that ever lived on the planet!","value":"Blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived on the planet!
