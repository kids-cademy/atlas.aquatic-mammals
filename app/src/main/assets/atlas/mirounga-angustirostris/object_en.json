{"index":26,"rank":0,"name":"mirounga-angustirostris","display":"Northern elephant seal","definition":"The northern elephant seal  is one of two species of elephant seal .","description":"<p>Northern elephant seals are generally brown in color, however there are variations to this coloration. </p><p>The most conspicuous feature to the male body is the inflated proboscis that adorns his face. </p><p>This feature is absent in females and is larger than that of their slightly larger close relatives, southern elephant seals. </p><p>These mammals are among the largest of the group comprising aquatic carnivores in the Northern Hemisphere. </p><p>Females typically weigh 600 to 900 kilograms and males, which outweigh females by 3 to 10 times, can top out at 2300 kilograms. </p><p>Females reach a length of 3.1 meters on average and males usually extend from 4 to 5 meters. </p><p>Teeth are dimorphic in the sexes, with males having considerably enlarged canines that are used in fighting.</p><p>These mammals can dive exceptionally deep, usually 500 to 600 meters with record of over 1500 meters, for extended periods of time  - between 20 and 70 minutes.</p><p>Northern elephant seals are found in the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of Alaska down to Baja California. </p><p>Northern elephant seals reside terrestrially on the sandy, rocky or muddy shores of the coastline, particularly on offshore islands. </p><p>These animals spend only 10% of their time on land, during reproduction and moulting. </p><p>The other 90% is spent in the water, diving and foraging for food, and only 11% of this time in the water is spent at the surface. </p><p>This means that an extraordinary 85 to 90% of their time is spent at sea and under water.</p><p>Females and males feed separately from each other. </p><p>Males are more likely to eat food sources that are dense in mass such as sharks and skates, while females eat foods that are less dense such as squid. </p><p>While elephant seals are on land they are fasting. </p><p>Foods eaten include cephalopods, skates, small sharks, and fish.</p><p>Northern elephant seals try to feed by diving deep when in the water because the animals that view them as prey typically feed near the surface. </p><p>Females migrate to the open ocean to feed in order to avoid predators as much as possible.</p><p>Northern elephant seals mating system is highly polygynous; a successful male is able to impregnate up to 50 females in one season.</p><p>These animals display a phenomenon in their development cycle called delayed implantation.</p><p> Delayed implantation lasts for about 3 months, resulting in a total gestation time of nearly one year. </p><p>Usually a single pup is born, although there have been occurrences of twins, and lactation will follow for about 27 days before the pup is weaned. </p><p>Pup weight gain during the period of lactation is phenomenal, the milk being extremely high in fat.</p><p>They typically aggregate in large groups while on land.</p><p>During their foraging migrations, they dive into the water repeatedly and continuously to find food, never stopping to rest or sleep for months at a time.</p><p>The male’s proboscis is used to produce extremely loud roaring noises, particularly during the mating season.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/mirounga-angustirostris/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/mirounga-angustirostris/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/mirounga-angustirostris/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/mirounga-angustirostris/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/mirounga-angustirostris/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/mirounga-angustirostris/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-22T05:43:48Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Mirounga"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Mirounga
