{"index":24,"rank":0,"name":"peponocephala-electra","display":"Melon-headed whale","definition":"The melon-headed whale is a small to medium sized toothed whale of the oceanic dolphin family .","description":"<p>The melon-headed whale belongs to the oceanic dolphin family. </p><p>It is closely related to the pygmy killer whale and pilot whale. </p><p>Collectively these dolphin species are known by the common name blackfish. </p><p>Melon-headed whales have a rounded cone head which gives the animal its common name. </p><p>The color of the body is light grey except for a dark grey face – sometimes called the mask. </p><p>The flippers are long and pointed. The dorsal fin is tall with a pointed tip.</p><p>Melon-headed whales are found beyond the continental shelf between 20°S and 20°N. </p><p>Most commonly they occur in the Philippines Sea. </p><p>Individuals have also been sighted off the southern coast of Ireland. </p><p>Melon-headed whales live far from shore in all the world's tropical and subtropical oceans. </p><p>At the northern fringes of their range, they may also be found in temperate waters.</p><p>Melon-headed whales are carnivorous. They typically feed on squid and small fish.</p><p>Little is known about predators of melon-headed whale. </p><p>Their medium to large size prevents them from attracting many predators, but perhaps large sharks or cetaceans would not be deterred by size alone. </p><p>No specific predators are known.</p><p>Little is known about the reproductive behavior or breeding habits of melon-headed whales. </p><p>It is suggested that calves are born year round. </p><p>Gestation period probably lasts about 12 months after which a single calf is born. </p><p>At birth calf weighs 10 to 15 kilograms and is one meter long. </p><p>Calves are capable of swimming soon after birth. </p><p>It is known that melon-headed whales reach reproductive maturity at around 4 years of age.</p><p>Melon-headed whales are very social animals. </p><p>They live in large groups numbering between 100 and 1,000. </p><p>Within these large groups, they usually swim in smaller groups of 10 to 14. </p><p>They have been seen swimming close to each other and touching flippers. </p><p>Groups of the melon-headed whales mix with groups of fraser’s dolphins and socialize with them. </p><p>They also associate with humpback whales and pilot whales. </p><p>Melon-headed whales spend much of their daytime at the surface resting. </p><p>When resting near the surface, they create large splashes when they break the water. </p><p>Several of them rise vertically out of the water to observe their surroundings and then splash back down. </p><p>This technique is known as spy hopping.</p><p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of the melon-headed whale is unknown. </p><p>Currently, this species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/peponocephala-electra/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/peponocephala-electra/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/peponocephala-electra/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/peponocephala-electra/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/peponocephala-electra/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/peponocephala-electra/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-24T03:02:09Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Delphinidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Peponocephala"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Peponocephala
