{"index":14,"rank":0,"name":"eschrichtius-robustus","display":"Gray whale","definition":"The gray whale is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly.","description":"<p>The gray whale is a giant of the ocean, mottled light to dark gray in color and encrusted with barnacles and whale lice. </p><p>It has no dorsal fin, instead having a series of bumps on the last third of its back along a dorsal ridge. </p><p>It has two deep grooves on its throat, which enable its mouth to expand when it feeds. </p><p>The baleen, which it uses to filter food, is creamy-white. </p><p>Females are usually larger than males and otherwise look the same as males.</p><p>There are two separate geographic distributions in the North Pacific Ocean of these whales.</p><p>The Eastern North Pacific stock, which inhabits North America’s west coast, and the Korean stock of the Western North Pacific, which occurs along the coasts of eastern Asia.</p><p>Gray whales are opportunistic feeders and their diet include a wide range of crustaceans.</p><p> They eat shrimp and amphipods, as well as herring eggs, polychaete worms, and various kinds of larvae.</p><p>Killer whales, the large sharks, and humans are the gray whales' only natural predators. </p><p>Skin parasites - including barnacles and whale lice, attach themselves to the head area, back, and blowhole area also.</p><p>Gray whales are promiscuous with complex breeding behavior. </p><p>After a gestation period of 13 to 14 months, a female bears a single calf, which she nurses until it is the age of 6 to 7 months. </p><p>Females are fiercely defensive of the young against potential predators. </p><p>The offspring inherit the feeding grounds of their mothers and are often seen in them a year after they become independent. </p><p>Gray whales achieve sexual maturity from 5 to 11 years of age.</p><p>Gray whales feed mainly during the long daylight hours of the summer months and often feed near to the shore. </p><p>They live in small groups, though sometimes form large pods, but don’t stay in the same group for all of their life. </p><p>Gray whales exhibit the behavior of spyhopping - lifting their heads right out of the water, exposing their entire rostrum for some minutes. </p><p>They do this while looking out for predators or other whales. </p><p>They also breach, which is understood to be a form of communication, a form of play, and an attempt at removing skin parasites. </p><p>Breaching is jumping up into the air then splash down onto their back or side.</p><p>Gray whales make the furthest migration known by any mammal. </p><p>Each spring and autumn they go from their summer feeding waters in the Arctic to the warm equatorial lagoons where the females give birth.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/eschrichtius-robustus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/eschrichtius-robustus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/eschrichtius-robustus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/eschrichtius-robustus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/eschrichtius-robustus/icon.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/eschrichtius-robustus/icon.png","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-23T22:48:33Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Eschrichtiidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Eschrichtius"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Eschrichtius
