{"index":6,"rank":0,"name":"zalophus-californianus","display":"California sea lion","definition":"The California sea lion  is a coastal eared seal native to western North America.","description":"<p>This species is the most recognized of the seals, because they are often seen in shows at aquariums and zoos doing acrobatic tricks. </p><p>California sea lions are known for their playfulness, intelligence, and noisy barking. </p><p>Their color can range from chocolate brown for a male to a lighter, golden brown for a female. </p><p>Their faces are dog-like, and at about five years old, a male develops a bony bump on the top of his skull, known as a sagittal crest. </p><p>Their external ears are obvious and they have long narrow forelimb flippers, which they use for very graceful swimming as well as walking on land.</p><p>California sea lions inhabit British Columbia in Canada and south to Baja, Mexico, including in the Gulf of California. </p><p>These sea lions typically live along coastlines but also occur in rivers along the coast of the northern Pacific. </p><p>They often gather on man-made structures like jetties, piers, oil platforms and offshore buoys.</p><p>California sea lions are carnivores, more preciselly piscivores and molluscivores. </p><p>They eat a large range of different fish species - some commercial species included, such as Pacific whiting, northern anchovies, and mackerel.</p><p>California sea lions also prey on some cephalopod species.</p><p>Predation is not a significant threat to healthy adult California sea lions. </p><p>Killer whales and large sharks occasionally prey on weaker California sea lions.</p><p>This species is polygynous, a male establishing a breeding territory that may contain up to fourteen females. </p><p>He defends his territory with vocalization and aggressive physical displays. </p><p>After a gestation of 11 months, a female gives birth to a single baby. </p><p>She spends the first week post birth with her pup and then begins alternating feeding trips out to sea and suckling bouts on land, for ten to twelve months, until her pup is weaned.</p><p>Being very social animals, California sea lions form groups onshore of several hundred individuals. </p><p>They typically haul out on rocky islets, buoys, and unused floating piers. </p><p>They are able to travel some distance in search of their favorite foods, but they feed mostly in areas of upwelling. </p><p>A California sea lion is a very fast, agile swimmer and can often be seen wave riding and porpoising. </p><p>Their dives typically last about two minutes, though they can last as long as ten minutes.</p><p>The average diving depths is between 26 and 98 meters, although they can go down to 400 meters.</p><p>Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations.</p><p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance.</p><p>To protect fish, the US states of Oregon and Washington engage in annual kill quotas of sea lions.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/zalophus-californianus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/zalophus-californianus/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/zalophus-californianus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/zalophus-californianus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/zalophus-californianus/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/zalophus-californianus/featured.png","caption":"<p>Mothers
