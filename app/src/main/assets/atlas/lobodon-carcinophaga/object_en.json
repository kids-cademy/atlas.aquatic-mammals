{"index":9,"rank":0,"name":"lobodon-carcinophaga","display":"Crabeater seal","definition":"The crabeater seal s a true seal with a circumpolar distribution around the coast of Antarctica.","description":"<p>Crabeater seals are considered to be the most abundant seals in the world. </p><p>It is believed by some scientists that there are more of them than all the other seal species combined. </p><p>Crabeater seals are a true or earless seal and perfectly adapted to living in Antarctica, almost exclusively amidst the pack ice. </p><p>They are faster than most true seals and can travel faster over ice than a person can run. </p><p>Ironically, these seals do not, in fact, eat crabs - Antarctic waters have no crabs, but they eat more krill than any other animal. </p><p>This seal’s abundance is largely a result of the slaughter in Antarctic whales of baleen whales, which made krill more available for seals and penguins.</p><p>Crabeater seals live throughout the Antarctic region. </p><p>They are found mainly on the pack ice and in the near freezing water off the coasts of Antarctica.</p><p>Some travel as far New Zealand, Tasmania, Australia, South America, and South Africa.</p><p>The Crabeater seals are carnivores and their diet is 89% Antarctic krill. </p><p>It probably eats other invertebrates as well.</p><p>This species feeds mostly at night, diving fairly deeply in search of prey. </p><p>During the day they rest on ice floes.</p><p>Crabeater seals are monogamous, which means that one male mates only with one female. </p><p>Gestation lasts about 11 months, probably due to delayed implantation. </p><p>A single pup is born in the following year, with most births occurring around mid-October. </p><p>A male usually joins the female just before birth takes place, and protects her and her newborn from other males and from predators. </p><p>The pup stays close by its mother until weaning takes place, which usually three to four weeks after birth. </p><p>Young are almost fully grown at two years old, although they do not reach maturity until three to six years old.</p><p>Crabeater seals spend most of their time alone or in a small group. </p><p>Much larger groups, however, sometimes with as many as about 1,000 individuals, have been seen hauling out on ice floes, particularly during the annual molt. </p><p>Up to 500 in a herd have been seen swimming and diving together. </p><p>In spring, juvenile and mature seals will segregate, the juveniles forming large groups on land while the mature ones stay on the pack ice during the breeding season. </p><p>These seals are extremely agile on land and sometimes are found far inland, juveniles sometimes accidentally traveling towards the interior of Antarctica. </p><p>It is assumed that they migrate during the Antarctic winter in search of food but their patterns of movement are unknown.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/lobodon-carcinophaga/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/lobodon-carcinophaga/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/lobodon-carcinophaga/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/lobodon-carcinophaga/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/lobodon-carcinophaga/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/lobodon-carcinophaga/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-20T22:22:47Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Lobodon"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Lobodon
