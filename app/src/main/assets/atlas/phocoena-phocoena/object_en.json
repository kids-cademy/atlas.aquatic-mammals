{"index":16,"rank":0,"name":"phocoena-phocoena","display":"Harbour porpoise","definition":"The harbour porpoise  is one of six species of porpoise.","description":"<p>The Harbour porpoise is smaller than other porpoises and has a plump body and a dark gray to bluish back, pale belly with a rounded head. </p><p>The female of the species is usually slightly larger than the male. </p><p>The color of the animal varies from individual to individual, but the most common coloration pattern is a dark dorsal surface that shifts to a lighter colored hue ventrally. </p><p>When born, the young have a dull color and usually have birth lines that look like folds in their skin, which last for a few hours after birth.</p><p>Found in both salt and fresh water areas, harbour porpoise require a shallow coastal body of water.</p><p>They live in coastal regions in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and the Arctic Oceans, as well as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean regions. </p><p>They inhabit estuaries, bays, and river mouths, and sometimes go further upriver. </p><p>They prefer shallow, cold coastal waters.</p><p>The Harbour porpoise eats mainly smooth, non-spiny fish, such as herring, pollack, hake, cod and sardines. </p><p>Other sea creatures including cephalopods and shrimp are also eaten.</p><p>Significant predators of harbour porpoises include white sharks and killer whales. </p><p>Studies revealed that the local bottlenose dolphins attack and kill harbour porpoises without eating them due to competition for a decreasing food supply.</p><p>Grey seals are also known to attack harbour porpoises by biting off chunks of fat as a high energy source.</p><p>Harbour porpoises are polygynandrous, two or more males mating with two or more female porpoises. </p><p>Females give birth to a single calf every year or every second year, following a gestation of 10 to 11 months. </p><p>The mothers usually take their newborns to secluded coves for nursing. </p><p>Lactation lasts approximately 8 to 12 months, though calves start to eat solid food at around 5 months of age. </p><p>Young porpoises stay with their mothers after weaning for up to a further 9 months. </p><p>They reach sexual maturity at the age of 3 to 4 years.</p><p>The Harbour porpoise is a social species that travels in groups of two to five members, but larger groups can form during migration. </p><p>Some populations migrate, but on return to their usual areas they are territorial, and patrol certain areas. </p><p>These porpoises usually swim near the water's surface, rising up to the surface about every 25 seconds to breathe, and their blow is not easy to see at sea. </p><p>They do not present an especially playful attitude, taking no notice of boats and hardly ever leaping above the water. </p><p>They can often be detected by their loud puffing sound as they breathe at the surface.</p><p>According to IUCN's Red List, the global number for this species is no fewer than 700,000 individuals. </p><p>Harbour porpoises are classified currently as least concern on the list of threatened species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/phocoena-phocoena/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/phocoena-phocoena/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/phocoena-phocoena/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/phocoena-phocoena/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/phocoena-phocoena/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/phocoena-phocoena/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-21T22:28:14Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocoenidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Phocoena"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Phocoena
