{"index":12,"rank":0,"name":"pseudorca-crassidens","display":"False killer whale","definition":"The false killer whale  is an oceanic dolphin that inhabits oceans worldwide but mainly frequents tropical regions.","description":"<p>The species is so called due to having similarities with the orca, also named killer whale. </p><p>Thus, the false killer whale has similar shape, number of teeth as well as skull shape and size as the orca. </p><p>The false killer whale is actually not a whale but a dolphin. </p><p>The animals have a whitish marking on their chest between the flippers. </p><p>In addition, some individuals exhibit pale grey patches on their heads. </p><p>In general, however, the coloration of their body is nearly entirely grey to black.</p><p>False killer whale occurs in tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. </p><p>Usually the animal inhabits the open ocean, but it can occasionally be observed around oceanic islands like Hawaii. </p><p>In addition, the false killer whale has been seen in semi-enclosed areas such as the Mediterranean.</p><p>The diet of this carnivorous animal considerably depends on the area of habitat, usually consisting of squid as well as various species of pelagic fish, tuna, wahoo and mahi mahi. </p><p>The false killer whale is also known to consume smaller dolphins, and can prey on humpback and sperm whales on occasion.</p><p>Due to their harmful effects on fisheries, humans kill false killer whales. </p><p>In some regions in the eastern tropical Pacific, they are hunted for meat.</p><p>The species is known to have promiscuous mating system, where both males and females mate with multiple mates. </p><p>The false killer whales mate throughout the year with peak periods, occurring from January to December and in March. </p><p>Gestation periods range from 11 to 16 months. </p><p>Females give birth to a single calf, after which they do not breed for about 7 years on average. </p><p>Soon after birth, the baby is able to swim. </p><p>The young is weaned gradually during the period of 18 to 24 months. </p><p>Even after weaning, calves often remain in the same group with their mother. </p><p>Males of this species are sexually mature by 8 to 10 years old, whereas females reach maturity within 8 to 11 years old.</p><p>These animals normally gather into pods, which can be very small (including just a few whales) and rather large (containing hundreds of individuals). </p><p>These large pods of false killer whales consist of smaller groups of 18 individuals on average. </p><p>The false killer whales are highly social animals, just like pilot whales. </p><p>These playful animals are identified due to being one of a few large mammals that tend to leap out of the water over the wake of a ship. </p><p>They favor riding bow waves of various vessels, preferring faster-moving ships. </p><p>False killer whales use a wide variety of clicks and whistles as a form of communication. </p><p>They also use echolocation, interacting through sounds, which help them detect prey and sense the ocean waters. </p><p>They generally hunt by day and night.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/pseudorca-crassidens/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/pseudorca-crassidens/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/pseudorca-crassidens/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/pseudorca-crassidens/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/pseudorca-crassidens/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/pseudorca-crassidens/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-23T21:46:29Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Delphinidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Pseudorca"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Pseudorca
