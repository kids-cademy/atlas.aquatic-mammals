{"index":13,"rank":0,"name":"balaenoptera-physalus","display":"Fin whale","definition":"The fin whale , also known as finback whale or common rorqual and formerly known as herring whale or razorback whale, is a cetacean belonging to the parvorder of baleen whales.","description":"<p>The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin, and porpoise.</p><p>The fin whale's body is long and slender, coloured brownish-grey with a paler underside.</p><p>It is the second-largest species on Earth after the blue whale.</p><p>The largest reportedly grow to 27.3 meters long with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9 meters</p><p>Maximum recorded weight is nearly 74 tonnes, and the maximum estimated weight is around 114 tonnes.</p><p>Fin whale is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters.</p><p>It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean.</p><p>The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters.</p><p>This species is highly migratory: they usually live in colder feeding water during spring and early summer, and in autumn and winter they go back to warmer waters to breed.</p><p>A fin whale is a filter feeder and hunts by swimming with its mouth open towards its prey, taking in large amounts of water as well as food. </p><p>Fin whale diet consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.</p><p>Killer whales are the only known natural predator of fin whales.</p><p>Anyway, due to fin whales' large adult size, only calves are likely to be truly vulnerable to predation.</p><p>Fin whales are regarded as monogamous, often being seen during the mating season in pairs. </p><p>After an 11 to 11.5 months gestation period, one calf is born. The mother nurses her baby for 6 to 8 months.</p><p>The calf is precocial at birth, and is able to swim as soon as it is born. </p><p>The calf is about 14 meters long when it is weaned, whereupon it travels to a polar feeding area with its mother, and learns there to feed independently of its mother. </p><p>Males are sexually mature at 6 to 10 years old. </p><p>Females give birth to a calf every two years once they reach sexual maturity between 3 to 12 years old.</p><p>Fin whales communicate with loud low-pitched sounds.</p><p>The purpose of these noises is unknown, but they may play a part in helping whales to locate each other or attract a mate.</p><p>Like all other large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century.</p><p>As a result, it is an endangered species.</p><p>Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived.</p><p>Recovery of the overall population size of southern subspecies is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-physalus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-physalus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-physalus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-physalus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/balaenoptera-physalus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-physalus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-19T04:32:46Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Balaenopteridae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Balaenoptera"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Balaenoptera physalus"}],"aliases":["Finback whale","Common rorqual","Herring whale","Razorback whale"],"spreading":[{"name":"World Ocean","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"NT","sampleTitle":"Fin whale song","samplePath":"atlas/balaenoptera-physalus/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/balaenoptera-physalus/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/balaenoptera-physalus/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Rarely breach out of the water","value":"Fin whales rarely breach out of the water."},{"name":"Fin whales feed in the cold waters","value":"Fin whales feed in the cold waters.
