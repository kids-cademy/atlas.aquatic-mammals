{"index":28,"rank":0,"name":"pusa-hispida","display":"Ringed seal","definition":"The ringed seal , also known as the jar seal, as netsik or nattiq by the Inuit, is an earless seal inhabiting the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.","description":"<p>Ringed seals are the smallest of the pinnipeds. </p><p>The color of their coat is variable, but it is usually dark gray on the upperparts, while being light gray to silver underneath. </p><p>Dark gray spots are ringed by silver or light grayish-white circles, which are clearer on the sides and back and often so close together that they fuse. </p><p>A ringed seal is plump with a small, round head and a thick, short neck. </p><p>Its broad, blunt snout and large, forward-facing, close-set eyes give it an appearance that is almost cat-like. </p><p>The front flippers are relatively small, with slightly pointed claws of about 2.5 centimeters in thickness, used for maintaining breathing holes in thick ice. </p><p>Their whiskers are beaded and light-colored. </p><p>Males are usually slightly larger than females.</p><p>Ringed seals inhabit the Arctic Ocean, the Bering Sea and the Okhotsk Sea, and the North Atlantic coastal parts of Scandinavia and Greenland. </p><p>Ringed seals do not come to shore through much of their range. </p><p>Instead, they live in Arctic waters and are typically found where there is pack ice and ice floes. </p><p>Further south and in Lake Ladoga and Lake Saimaa these seals rest on rocks, offshore reefs and island shores when ice is absent.</p><p>Ringed seals are generalists and their diet includes a range of fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, euphausiids, amphipods, mysids and shrimp.</p><p>Ringed seals are one of the primary prey of polar bears and have long been a component of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic.</p><p>Adults can also be taken by killer whales, greenland sharks, and the occasional walrus. </p><p>Pups are also prey to Arctic foxes and glaucous gulls.</p><p>Ringed seals are polygynous, one male mating with multiple females. </p><p>The females build lairs amongst the thick ice where they give birth. </p><p>In March or April, after gestation of 9 months, they bear a single pup. </p><p>They nurse their pups for 5 to 7 weeks, and, during this time, may move their pups between lairs, usually having 4 to 6 lairs. </p><p>This allows pups to move independently from shelter to shelter when they are older, if they are attacked. </p><p>Females usually bear pups between the ages of 6 and 8. </p><p>Males typically do not breed until they are 8 to 10 years old.</p><p>Ringed seals are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day. </p><p>Adults are solitary except during the breeding season when they may establish their lairs closer to each other. </p><p>Ringed seals hunt on their own, and on the ice when resting they will keep away from others. </p><p>They usually stay near to holes or cracks so that they can get quickly into the water if they need to. </p><p>They make lairs from snow to protect themselves.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/pusa-hispida/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/pusa-hispida/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/pusa-hispida/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/pusa-hispida/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/pusa-hispida/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/pusa-hispida/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-20T03:44:39Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Pusa"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Pusa
