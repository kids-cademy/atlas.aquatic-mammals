During its life, a female yields 4 to 5 calves.</p><p>Short-finned pilot whales are social and highly playful animals. </p><p>Females of this species gather into kinship pods, whereas males usually move between pods. </p><p>They are likely to be more active and socialize during the night, when they feed. </p><p>Short-finned pilot whales are nomadic species, constantly traveling long distances to find suitable food. </p><p>Members of a pod communicate with each other visually, physically and acoustically. </p><p>Acoustic communication includes vocalizations such as whistles and clicks, whereas physical communication includes tail slapping and breaching.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/globicephala-macrorhynchus/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/globicephala-macrorhynchus/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/globicephala-macrorhynchus/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/globicephala-macrorhynchus/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/globicephala-macrorhynchus/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/globicephala-macrorhynchus/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-21T15:43:43Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Delphinidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Globicephala"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Globicephala
