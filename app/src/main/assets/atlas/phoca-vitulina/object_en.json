{"index":15,"rank":0,"name":"phoca-vitulina","display":"Harbor seal","definition":"The harbor  seal is a true seal found along temperate and Arctic marine coastlines of the Northern Hemisphere.","description":"<p>The most widely distributed species of pinniped, harbor seals are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic, Pacific Oceans, Baltic and North Seas.</p><p>The harbor seal is relatively small in comparison with the many other seal species. </p><p>Its color can vary from light gray, white or yellowish gray with darker spots, to gray, black or brown with spots or light rings. </p><p>Its fur is short and thick, with coarse guard hair and dense, fine underhair. </p><p>They have a gland in their skin which secretes oil to waterproof their fur.</p><p>Blubber under the seal's skin helps to maintain body temperature.</p><p>An adult can attain a length of 1.85 m and a mass of up to 168 kg.</p><p>Females outlive males with a lifespan of 30 to 35 years, whereas males life expectancy is 20 to 25 years.</p><p>Harbor seals live along Arctic coastlines and are also found in the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, so are usually well spread out. </p><p>A small number has also been seen in the North Sea. </p><p>They prefer coastal waters near to the shore and are often seen on rocky islands, mudflats, sandy beaches, bays, and estuaries.</p><p>These seals are carnivorous generalists, eating small to medium-sized fish, including cod, herring and mackerel, as well as crustaceans, octopus, and squid. </p><p>Shrimp are especially important for young harbor seal pups.</p><p>Harbor seal predators include killer whales, sharks, bears, coyotes, foxes, large birds, and Steller sea lions. </p><p>Sea otters have even been known to drown harbor seal pups.</p><p>Harbor seals are polygynous, one male having exclusive mating rights with many females. </p><p>Males may fight over mates under water and on land.</p><p>A female will give birth to a single pup during spring, after a gestation period of 9 to 11 months. </p><p>The newborn seal is covered in fur and is able to swim with its mother and go onto land after her within a few minutes of being born. </p><p>They develop quickly on their mothers' fat-rich milk,  and after 4 to 6 weeks pups are weaned and have achieved independence.</p><p>Males reach sexual maturity between 3 to 7 years old and females at about 3 to 6 years old.</p><p>Harbor seals stick to familiar resting spots or haulout sites, generally rocky areas, where they are protected from adverse weather conditions and predation, near a foraging area.</p><p>The global population of harbor seals is 315,000, but subspecies in certain habitats are threatened.</p><p>Once a common practice, sealing is now illegal in many nations within the animal's range.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/phoca-vitulina/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/phoca-vitulina/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/phoca-vitulina/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/phoca-vitulina/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/phoca-vitulina/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/phoca-vitulina/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-20T03:14:20Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Phoca"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Phoca
