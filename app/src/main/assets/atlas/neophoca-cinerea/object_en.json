{"index":2,"rank":0,"name":"neophoca-cinerea","display":"Australian sea lion","definition":"The Australian sea lion is a species of sea lion that is the only endemic pinniped in Australia.","description":"<p>The Australian sea lion is a species of sea mammals. </p><p>Distinctive features of these sea lions are: muzzles - tapered, long and narrow; sagittal crests on their skulls; extremely small ears, lying close to their heads. </p><p>Males of the Australian sea lion are dark chocolate brown with a yellow mane, whereas females are either silver or fawn, with a cream underbelly.</p><p>Young are also dark brown, having dark mask on their face and a pale crown.</p><p>Australian sea lions live mainly in isolated bays as well as on ocean and sandy beaches. </p><p>The area of their distribution includes islands, offshore of Australia; these sea lions are found from Western Australia to islands in southern Australia. </p><p>Due to being excellent climbers, the Australian sea lions can be seen on cliffs, sometimes climbing as high as 60 meters.</p><p>Australian sea lions are carnivores, more precisely piscivores and molluscivores. </p><p>Their regular diet includes octopus, blue-throated wrasses, squids, fairy penguins and cuttlefish. </p><p>They also eat certain species of fish such as small sharks, rays and whiting.</p><p>One of the predators of the Australian sea lion is the great white shark, especially near the Dangerous Reef region of the Port Lincoln area.</p><p>Fishermen also occasionally kill them accidentally by entangling them in their nets. </p><p>Historically, the population was greatly reduced due to sealing.</p><p>The Australian sea lions are polygynous, meaning that one male can mate with multiple females. </p><p>Breeding cycle of these sea lions is about 1.5 year while gestation period lasts 11 months, after which a single baby is born. </p><p>The pups usually live with their mother during the first year after birth. </p><p>They often join groups of other pups, where they play together and participate in mock battles. </p><p>Weaning takes place at the age of 15 to 18 months while sexual maturity is reached as the age of 3 to 6 years.</p><p>The sea lions are mainly diurnal. </p><p>They are highly sociable and communicative animals, gathering in large colonies on the land. </p><p>They also congregate into more intimate social units – subgroups - that contain 10 to 15 individuals on average. </p><p>They can move from one subgroup to another, depending on their needs. </p><p>Since the sea lions are non-migratory animals, they usually remain near to their birthplace throughout the life, living and breeding on sandy beaches. </p><p>Looking for food, they can dive up to 250 meters, staying up to 40 minutes under the water. </p><p>Some sea lions have been known to swallow small stones: perhaps, it’s done to balance the weight when diving under the water.</p><p>With a population estimated at around 6,500 animals, the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia has listed them as in need of special protection.</p><p>Their Conservation status is listed as endangered.</p>","images":{"cover":{"path":"atlas/neophoca-cinerea/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neophoca-cinerea/cover.png","caption":null},"contextual":{"path":"atlas/neophoca-cinerea/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neophoca-cinerea/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"featured":{"path":"atlas/neophoca-cinerea/featured.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neophoca-cinerea/featured.png","caption":"<p>Australian
