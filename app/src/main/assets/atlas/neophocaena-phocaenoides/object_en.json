{"index":20,"rank":0,"name":"neophocaena-phocaenoides","display":"Indo-Pacific finless porpoise","definition":"The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise is one of seven porpoise species.","description":"<p>Finless porpoises are named for and distinguished by the absence of a dorsal fin. </p><p>Instead of this fin, there is a small ridge on their backs that starts just behind their blowhole and extends as far as the tail flukes. </p><p>Small circular bumps called tubercles cover the ridge. </p><p>They have unfused neck vertebrae, which enables unrestricted head movement, and they have a small, curving mouth. </p><p>About half of them have pink eyes. </p><p>Their streamlined body is blue-gray, though in northern China and Japan adults are light gray.</p><p>The Finless porpoise inhabits the coasts of eastern and southern Asia from the Arabian Gulf eastwards to Japan and southwards to Java, Indonesia. </p><p>It inhabits warm temperate and tropical coastal waters, preferring waters above sandy or soft bottoms, such as mangroves, shallow bays and estuaries. </p><p>It is also found in large rivers.</p><p>The Finless porpoise's diet can vary depending on the location. </p><p>However, they generally eat fish, prawn, shrimp, squid and octopus.</p><p>Given the habitat of the finless porpoise the most likely natural predator of these marine mammals are local sharks. </p><p>Their large size - when compared to other local ocean animals, and coastal lifestyle makes them less of a target for other potential predators.</p><p>Finless porpoises are polygynous, which means that one male mates with multiple females. </p><p>Young are born in winter, spring, or summer, depending on their location, after a gestation from ten to eleven months. </p><p>Finless porpoises give birth to a single calf. </p><p>Feeding continues from 6 months to more than a year. </p><p>The mother is usually the caregiver and swims with her calf until it has fully matured. </p><p>Males gain sexual maturity between 4 and 6 years old, and females between 6 to 9 years.</p><p>The Finless porpoise usually forms small schools and is hardly ever seen in groups larger than 4 individuals. </p><p>Some of these groups (mainly near Japan) are migratory. </p><p>They live in the Inland Sea in the spring, and between late summer and mid-winter they migrate to the Pacific coast. </p><p>Finless porpoises are active animals, swimming just below the water's surface with sudden, darting movements. </p><p>They disturb the water little when they break the surface, and they usually roll onto their sides as they do so. </p><p>Finless porpoises tend to be shy and they avoid boats. </p><p>Calves are known to ride on their mother's back, gripping onto the dorsal ridge, coming up out of the water as the mother comes up to breathe.</p><p>The total number of the Finless porpoise population is unknown for today but there are estimates available for certain areas.</p><p>Overall, Finless porpoise numbers are decreasing today and they are classified as vulnerable on the list of threatened species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/neophocaena-phocaenoides/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neophocaena-phocaenoides/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/neophocaena-phocaenoides/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neophocaena-phocaenoides/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/neophocaena-phocaenoides/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neophocaena-phocaenoides/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-22T03:55:06Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocoenidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Neophocaena"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Neophocaena
