{"index":10,"rank":0,"name":"ziphius-cavirostris","display":"Cuvier's beaked whale","definition":"Cuvier's beaked whale is the most widely distributed of all the beaked whales.","description":"<p>Cuvier's beaked whale is widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans. </p><p>The color of their skin may vary greatly from individual to individual, though usually it ranges from dark slate-grey to rusty brown. </p><p>As the animals age, the color on their head, neck and back lightens, which is more noticeable in male individuals. </p><p>Thus, the skin color of head in old males seems to be almost entirely white. </p><p>In addition, adult males of this species are easily identified by two large, cylindrical teeth, incongruously projecting from the tip of their lower jaw. </p><p>In a study published in March 2014, scientists tracked these typically elusive whales and reported one whale dived to the dizzying depths of 2,992 meters. </p><p>The same whale stayed underwater, without taking a single breath, for 138 minutes.</p><p>The species occurs throughout the world, inhabiting temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters of most of the world's seas and oceans. </p><p>Cuvier's beaked whales live in the open sea, normally greater than 1,000 meters, of the continental slope and edge. </p><p>They can be found around banks, seamounts and submarine canyons. </p><p>A scientific survey has shown that these animals also frequent currents, current boundaries, and core ring features.</p><p>Cuvier's beaked whales are carnivores. </p><p>Their diet primarily consists of squid, supplemented with fish and occasional crustaceans.</p><p>Cuvier's beaked whale may face threats from natural predators, however this has not been well researched. </p><p>Scars found on the bodies of some whales indicate that they may be preyed upon by sharks. </p><p>Given their large demographic it is possible that they may face attacks from killer whales as well.</p><p>Presently, quite a little is known about the reproductive behavior of these whales, since the animals are rarely seen at sea. </p><p>They are likely to breed and give birth throughout the year with peak period, occurring in spring. </p><p>Females give birth with an interval of 2 to 3 years. </p><p>Gestation period lasts for a year, yielding a single calf.</p><p>These wales usually occur in groups of 2 to 7 animals, though some animals, mostly males, can be found alone. </p><p>Cuvier's beaked whales do not tend to show active behavior such as breaching, when they are at the surface. </p><p>The blow of this animal is hardly seen; it occurs with intervals of 20 to 30 seconds, pointing to the left and a bit forward while reaching one meter in length. </p><p>When the whale swims, the body and the head of the animal emerge from the water. </p><p>Before a deep, vertical dive, Cuvier's beaked whale arches its back more than usually, showing its flukes. </p><p>Hunting in the lightless depths, the animal uses echolocation to detect potential prey.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/ziphius-cavirostris/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/ziphius-cavirostris/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/ziphius-cavirostris/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/ziphius-cavirostris/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/ziphius-cavirostris/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/ziphius-cavirostris/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-19T19:00:41Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Ziphiidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Ziphius"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Ziphius
