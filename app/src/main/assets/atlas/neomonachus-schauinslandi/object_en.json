{"index":17,"rank":0,"name":"neomonachus-schauinslandi","display":"Hawaiian monk seal","definition":"The Hawaiian monk seal  , is an endangered species of earless seal in the family Phocidae that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.","description":"<p>Hawaiian monk seals exhibit sexual dimorphism, with females being larger than males. </p><p>Females have an average length of 2.3 m and an average weight of 270 kg. </p><p>Males have an average length of 2.1 m and an average weight of 220 kg. </p><p>Adults have brown pelage that is slightly gray on their backs and gradually fades to yellow and then white near the ventral surface of the animal. </p><p>Juveniles are silvery gray, with darker hair on their dorsal side and white hair on their ventral side. </p><p>Hawaiian monk seals have broad, flat, and moderately small heads with large black eyes. </p><p>Unlike other pinnipeds, their nostrils are located on top of their short snout.</p><p>Hawaiian monk seals are endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago and are found primarily in the tropical waters of the northwestern Hawaiian island chain.</p><p>Hawaiian monk seals utilize terrestrial and marine habitats. </p><p>Sandy beaches are used for parturition, nursing, molting, and resting. </p><p>The most common parturition sites are on sandy beaches with exposed protective reefs, which limit shark access and provide shelter from large surf.</p><p>Hawaiian monk seals primarily prey upon teleost fishes, which make up roughly 80% of their diet. </p><p>They appear to prefer marine eels, wrasses, squirrelfishes and soldierfishes, triggerfishes and parrotfishes. </p><p>Except for the beardfish family, which consists of deep sea benthic fishes, all fishes consumed by Hawaiian monk seals are shallow reef fishes . </p><p>The remainder of the their diet consists of cephalopods and crustaceans, with the majority of consumed cephalopods being octopi.</p><p>The main predator of Hawaiian monk seals is the tiger shark, and shark predation is believed to be a significant contributing factor to pup mortality. </p><p>Although male Hawaiian monk seals are known to commit infanticide, sharks are thought to be the main threat to pup survival. </p><p>Seals avoid potential predators by nesting on beaches protected by exposed reefs and by feeding and resting in underwater reef caves.</p><p>Hawaiian monk seals are monestrous and give birth to a single pup each year.</p><p>Females leave the ocean to give birth on beaches close to their most recent breeding site. </p><p>Birthing takes place after an 11 months gestation period, which contains a 3 months period of delayed implantation. </p><p>Females are solely responsible for rearing offspring, which takes about 40 days. </p><p>Pups weigh between 14 and 17 kilograms at birth and between 50 and 100 kilograms at weaning.</p><p>Both genders reach sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 10 years old.</p><p>Hawaiian monk seals communicate using vocalizations, including those between mothers and nursing pups.</p><p>Except during the breeding season, Hawaiian monk seals are generally solitary animals, living alone or in some cases in small groups. </p><p>Hawaiian monk seals are nocturnal and are non-migratory. </p><p>They spend much of their time at sea foraging, returning to shore to sleep. </p><p>They are extremely agile in the water and use their back flippers to steer their fusiform bodies.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/neomonachus-schauinslandi/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neomonachus-schauinslandi/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/neomonachus-schauinslandi/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neomonachus-schauinslandi/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/neomonachus-schauinslandi/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/neomonachus-schauinslandi/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-22T14:04:57Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Phocidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Neomonachus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Neomonachus
