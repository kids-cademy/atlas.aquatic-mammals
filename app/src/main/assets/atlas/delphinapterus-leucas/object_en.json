when the sea ice melts in summer, they move to warmer river estuaries and coastal areas.</p><p>Some populations are sedentary and do not migrate over great distances during the year.</p><p>Beluga whales are opportunistic feeders and their diets vary according to their locations and the season.</p><p>Belugas eat a variety of prey, such as smelt, flatfish, flounder, salmon, sculpins, and cod. </p><p>They also eat invertebrates such as crabs, clams, shrimps, worms, octopus, squid, and more creatures that live on the seabed.</p><p>Belugas enemies are killer whales and polar bears that prey on both adults and calves.</p><p>Other threats include contamination of rivers - which bioaccumulate up the food chain, and infectious diseases.</p><p>Beluga whales are polygynous, a dominant male often mating with several females during one mating season. </p><p>Gestation lasts 14 months and a single calf is produced. </p><p>The calf has a grayish color and is very well developed. </p><p>The nursery pod stays together during the delivery, then all of them move off except for a teenage nursemaid. </p><p>Birthing usually takes place near rivers because the temperature of the water is ten degrees higher there. </p><p>This is for the benefit of the calf, which has less blubber than a full-grown adult. </p><p>A calf totally depends on its mother’s milk for one year, and lactation lasts as long as 1.5 to 2 years. </p><p>Females are sexually mature in 4 to 7 years, and males in 7 to 9 years.</p><p>The beluga whale is a diurnal and very social animal. </p><p>During summer, thousands of them gather together in river estuaries to moult. </p><p>They rub their bodies on the gravel of the sea bed to shed their yellow, withered skin from the previous year and to again become gleaming white.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/delphinapterus-leucas/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/delphinapterus-leucas/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/delphinapterus-leucas/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/delphinapterus-leucas/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/delphinapterus-leucas/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/delphinapterus-leucas/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-19T11:54:39Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Artiodactyla"},{"name":"infraorder","display":"Infraorder","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Monodontidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Delphinapterus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Delphinapterus leucas"}],"aliases":["White whale","Beluga","Sea canary"],"spreading":[{"name":"Artic Ocean","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Beluga whale calls","samplePath":"atlas/delphinapterus-leucas/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/delphinapterus-leucas/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/delphinapterus-leucas/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Neck vertebrae are not fused","value":"Vertebrae in the beluga's neck are not fused, which allow animal to rotate its head freely and move it in all directions."},{"name":"Baby belugas are gray","value":"Although belugas are known by their white skin, they are grey, brown or black in color at birth.
