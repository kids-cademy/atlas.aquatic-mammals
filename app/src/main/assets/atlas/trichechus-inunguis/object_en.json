{"index":1,"rank":0,"name":"trichechus-inunguis","display":"Amazonian manatee","definition":"The Amazonian manatee  is a species of manatee that lives in the Amazon Basin in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.","description":"<p>The Amazonian manatee is an aquatic mammal with a bizarre appearance, first described as follows: a curious combination of a seal and a hippopotamus. </p><p>Living just in bodies of freshwater, these manatees are typically found in lagoons and lakes, often off the branches of bigger rivers. </p><p>This enables them to travel back and forth between access points when they are in need of a good supply of plant life to eat. </p><p>The Amazonian manatee has been sighted in all parts of the Amazon River Basin. </p><p>In the wild these animals live for up to 30 years and in captivity around 12.5 years.</p><p>Amazonian manatees occur throughout the Amazon Basin in northern South America. </p><p>They only live in freshwater and they prefer oxbows, blackwater lakes, and lagoons which have deep connections to big rivers and plenty of aquatic vegetation.</p><p>As herbivorous species, the Amazonian manatee eats aquatic vegetation like grasses, water hyacinths and water lettuce. </p><p>It will also eat floating palm fruits. Individuals in captivity are able to eat 9 to 15 kilograms per day of leafy vegetables.</p><p>Natural predators of Amazonian manatee include jaguars, caimans, and sharks.</p><p>Mating herds form that consist of a male and a few females. </p><p>The females have the freedom to leave their herd and so may mate with another male, meaning that Amazonian manatees may have a polyandrous mating system. </p><p>Breeding can take place throughout the year, with peaks occurring at different times in various parts of the system of rivers. </p><p>In the central Amazon, births mostly occur in February-May, which is when water levels rise. </p><p>A single young is born after gestation of around one year. </p><p>Births occur at 2 to 3 year intervals. </p><p>Young are very well looked after by their mothers, who will nurse them up to the age of 18 months. </p><p>Males are 5 to 6 years old when they first mate, and females much younger, with their average age being about 3 years old.</p><p>Amazonian manatees are gregarious animals and used to occur in big herds. </p><p>Due to severe overhunting, however, groups seen today number only 4 to 8 individuals. </p><p>These manatees are both nocturnal and diurnal and they live their lives almost entirely underwater. </p><p>Only their nostrils stick up above the water as they search the bottoms of rivers and lakes for lush vegetation. </p><p>An individual in one day can eat as much as eight percent of its body weight of aquatic vegetation. </p><p>Feeding mostly takes place in the wet season, when these animals graze on new plants in backwaters that are flooded seasonally. </p><p>When the manatees return during the dry season to the primary water courses, for weeks they may not eat.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/trichechus-inunguis/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/trichechus-inunguis/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/trichechus-inunguis/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/trichechus-inunguis/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/trichechus-inunguis/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/trichechus-inunguis/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-24T09:48:34Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Sirenia"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Trichechidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Trichechus"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Trichechus
