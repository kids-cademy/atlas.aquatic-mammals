{"index":30,"rank":0,"name":"otaria-flavescens","display":"South American sea lion","definition":"The South American sea lion is a sea lion found on the coasts of South America.","description":"<p>South American sea lions males are approximately three times the size of females.</p><p>Adult males range from 2 to 2.5 meters in height and can weigh from 200 to 350 kilograms. </p><p>The coat is dark brown on the dorsal side and dark yellow to gold on the ventral side. </p><p>Males have a full mane, which is a paler color than the coat and a larger, more muscled neck than do females. </p><p>Adult females are much smaller in size and weight. Their coats are also lighter in color relative to males. </p><p>Coat color ranges from a fair brown to yellow with some pale markings around the head.</p><p>The South American sea lion lives along the South American coastlines on the Atlantic side from Rio de Janeiro to Perú on the Pacific side in southernmost South America. </p><p>They live along shorelines and beaches, which usually consist of sand, rocks, gravel or pebbles. </p><p>They also occur on flat rocky shelves or on cliffs with boulders and tide pools.</p><p>A South American sea lion are carnivores and eat fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, as well as other invertebrates, depending on what is available locally.</p><p>South American sea lions generally hunt in shallower waters, less than five miles out from the shore. </p><p>They hunt in groups when seeking prey that travel in schools.</p><p>South American sea lion natural predators include pumas, sharks, and killer whales.</p><p>This sea lion has a polygynous lifestyle. </p><p>Gestation is for about 11 to 12 months, and usually one pup is born. </p><p>Mothers mate again soon after birth with the male whose territory the birth took place in. </p><p>Pups spend most of the day in pods or groups playing, sleeping, or staying near the water. </p><p>They first go into the water usually after about 3 to 4 weeks in a large group with other sea lions. </p><p>Pups nurse for around 6 to 12 months, until their mother bears another pup, though some mothers nurse both pups at the same time.</p><p>South American sea lions are a diurnal and social species which lives in groups usually consisting of multiple females with one or several males who defend their territory. </p><p>Males, called bulls, patrol their range actively, threatening intruders, and advertising their territorial boundaries by means of vocalizations. </p><p>Fights are, however, rare, unless an intruder attempts to take over the bull’s territory. </p><p>His territory is very dependent on cows being present rather than its size or any topological features. </p><p>Each bull usually has 18 cows within his territory. </p><p>Younger males who do not yet have any mating females usually live in groups with 10 to 40 other young males, and try to raid the established territories of bulls to obtain females.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/otaria-flavescens/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/otaria-flavescens/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/otaria-flavescens/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/otaria-flavescens/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/otaria-flavescens/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/otaria-flavescens/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-20T21:29:42Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Carnivora"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Otariidae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Otaria"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Otaria
