After gestation of 11.5 months, one calf is born. </p><p>Females must feed their calves around 45 kg of milk every day for 5 to 7 months until weaning, and calves may remain with their mothers for as much as a year. </p><p>Mothers are affectionate and protective towards their calves, swimming nearby and often touching their babies with their flippers. </p><p>Male humpbacks do not give parental support for calves. </p><p>These whales are sexually mature when they are 4 to 5 years old, and the birthing interval is 2 years.</p><p>It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers.</p><p>Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time.</p><p>All the males in a group will produce the same song which is different each season.</p><p>Like other large whales, the humpback was a target for the whaling industry.</p><p>Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium.</p><p>While stocks have partially recovered to some 80,000 animals worldwide, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to affect the species.</p>","images":{"contextual":{"path":"atlas/megaptera-novaeangliae/contextual.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/megaptera-novaeangliae/contextual.jpg","caption":null},"cover":{"path":"atlas/megaptera-novaeangliae/cover.png","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/megaptera-novaeangliae/cover.png","caption":null},"icon":{"path":"atlas/megaptera-novaeangliae/icon.jpg","src":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/megaptera-novaeangliae/icon.jpg","caption":null}},"lastUpdated":"2020-02-19T12:37:36Z","taxonomy":[{"name":"kingdom","display":"Kingdom","value":"Animalia"},{"name":"phylum","display":"Phylum","value":"Chordata"},{"name":"class","display":"Class","value":"Mammalia"},{"name":"order","display":"Order","value":"Cetacea"},{"name":"suborder","display":"Suborder","value":"Mysticeti"},{"name":"family","display":"Family","value":"Balaenopteridae"},{"name":"genus","display":"Genus","value":"Megaptera"},{"name":"species","display":"Species","value":"Megaptera novaeangliae"}],"aliases":[],"spreading":[{"name":"World Ocean","area":"ALL","less":null,"lessArea":"ALL"}],"startDate":{"value":23.03,"mask":132102},"endDate":null,"conservation":"LC","sampleTitle":"Humpback whale song","samplePath":"atlas/megaptera-novaeangliae/sample.mp3","waveformPath":"atlas/megaptera-novaeangliae/waveform.png","waveformSrc":"/media/atlas/aquatic-mammals/megaptera-novaeangliae/waveform.png","facts":[{"name":"Very large flippers","value":"Humpback whales have very large flippers that can reach the length of one third of their body size."},{"name":"Baby usually has 3 to 4.2 meters","value":"Baby usually has 3 to 4.2 meters in length and can weigh up to one ton at birth.
